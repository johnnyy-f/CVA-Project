# CVA-Project

Designed and implemented a CVA calculation framework for an Interest Rate Swap (IRS), utilizing the Hull-White model to simulate interest rate paths. Combined Expected Positive Exposure (EPE), default probability, and recovery rate to quantify counterparty credit risk, leveraging Monte Carlo simulations and data visualization for enhanced risk assessment
